        <p class="card-text">Images should be great quality, proper resolution (with support for retina devices). Images should help provide ease by quickly and clearly directing users attention. Images should keep other elements surrounding the image box in mind. <code>The frame is as important as the image itself.</code></p>
        <p>Images should also provide a sense of happiness and motivation and relatability for users. Users may have different expectations of imagery depending on personal metrics (happiness, health, motivation level, etc). </p>
